**Warning:** Evernest is still under development. Some features may not be fully implemented yet.

Evernest is an easy-to-use event store service.

A large part of daily data come from different kind of log and are not easy to manage. They can be found in very different places and with different representation format.

Evernest provides a simple unified way to store and visualize event-driven data thanks to a flexible API in one hand and a nice user interface in another one.
